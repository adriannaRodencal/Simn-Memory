#2048 - Christmas Edition
____
###Description
2048 is a mobile game that was released by Gabriele Cirulli in 2014.  The goal of the game is to slide numbered tiles on a grid and combine them to reach a higher number.  This is a festive version of 2048 that will get you in the Christmas mood with fun visuals and music.  It is written in python and uses pygame.

###Getting Started
####Mac: 
Download the dmg file and proceed with the installation like you would with any other application.  You will need to go to security settings in system preferences and allow my app to run since it isn't from a trusted developer.  Make sure to drag the application into your application folder if you would like to run it more than once.

####PC: 

Stable: Download and Extract the compressed version of this project.  You will need to have python and pygame installed.  Once those are downloaded, you should be able to run the program without any problems.

Experimental: Download the msi file and proceed with the installation like you would with any other application.  The PC installer is currently somewhat broken.  For some reason, when you launch the application from search, it does not work.  If you launch from anywhere else, it works fine.  I am currently working on finding a better tool to create the windows installer.

####Linux: 

Download and Extract the compressed version of this project.  You will need to have python and pygame installed.  Once those are downloaded, you should be able to run the program without any problems.
